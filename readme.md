### Description  
 With this library you can get JSON object that will be automaticly saved to a file , also you can provide it with file content encryption. You can use this object as normal JSON object in javascript , for the most part, with minor exceptions, which are will be point out later on in this readme.  
#### in short
- auto json to file sync (main)
- auto file encryption (optional)
- cross module object access sharing (optional)
----- 
  
Complex objects are not fully sync and never be as this is intentional! 
ie if you are using vars in your object constructor , they will not be synced
It's not intended to work with large pieces of data, it's not database
